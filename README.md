## Getting Started

The website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). To run it locally you'll need Node.js 14.6.0 or newer. After cloning repository and running `yarn` to install the project dependencies, try any of the following three commands in the terminal:

- `yarn run dev` for running a development instance with hot-reloading, file watching and task re-running
- `yarn run build` for compiling the project.
- `yarn start` for starting your app in production mode.

To run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to view the site.
