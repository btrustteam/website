My scepticism at the onset has been proved wrong due to its continued and recent advancement. Although I've always been a bitcoin follower, after learning about some of the intricacies of bitcoin technology during the study sessions with Qala, I wanted more than ever to explore the technology and contribute to it. Another major reason is that there are only a few pioneers actively developing Bitcoin. For a technology that has proven its potential and is ever evolving, I'd like to contribute my quota and enable its sustainability in the world at large. As a Bitcoin user, I was impressed, and now that I'm transitioning into its development, all I can say is that the possibilities are endless and exciting.",
    "learning_at_qala": "The fact that there is always something new to learn is the first. You never reach/achieve the status of know-it-all,which fascinates me because I believe life is all about continuous learning. I get to study a lot of Bitcoin principles while learning new programming skills for a nascent technology like Bitcoin, especially with the projects. Second, colleagues and mentors have been tremendously supportive. Everyone wants to see me develop in a non-competitive and conflict-free environment. This touches me, and I hope the Qala community remains that way. Finally, studying at Qala has given me the opportunity to view the world of finance through the corrective lens afforded by Bitcoin technology.",
